## 🚀 **YOUR FIRST 3 STEPS (Do This Now!):**

### Step 1: Verify Setup (2 minutes)
```bash
python check_setup.py
```
**Expected:** All dependencies installed, data files found ✅

### Step 2: Explore Data (5 minutes)
```bash
python explore_data.py
```
**You'll see:**
- 13 classes total
- Class distribution (imbalanced!)
- Image statistics

### Step 3: Visualize Samples (2 minutes)
```bash
python visualize_samples.py
```
**You'll see:**
- What each cell type looks like
- Visual differences between classes
- Saved as `class_samples_visualization.png`

## 📋 **YOUR 14-DAY PLAN (Summary):**

### **Week 1: Foundation**
- **Day 1**: Setup + data exploration ✅ (Do this now!)
- **Day 2**: Train baseline model (EfficientNet-B0)
- **Day 3-4**: Train better model (EfficientNet-B4)
- **Day 5-6**: Handle class imbalance
- **Day 7**: First ensemble

### **Week 2: Optimization**
- **Day 8-9**: Advanced techniques
- **Day 10-11**: Hyperparameter tuning
- **Day 12-13**: Final ensemble
- **Day 14**: Submit to Kaggle!

## 🎯 **KEY INSIGHTS:**

### What You DON'T Need:
- ❌ Custom architectures (EfficientNet is already state-of-the-art)
- ❌ New algorithms (everything is implemented)
- ❌ Complex math (code handles it)

### What You DO Need:
- ✅ Follow the step-by-step guide
- ✅ Run the commands
- ✅ Track your experiments
- ✅ Iterate systematically

### The Secret:
1. **Start simple** - Get baseline working first
2. **Improve iteratively** - One change at a time
3. **Handle class imbalance** - Critical for this competition
4. **Ensemble models** - Biggest improvement
5. **Test thoroughly** - Before submission
